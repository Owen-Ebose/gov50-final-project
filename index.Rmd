## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring the impact of British Commonwealth membership on political attitude, nationalism, and democratic participation. Do citizens of countries that remove the Monarch as their head of state develop a greater sense of national pride and therefore a greater desire to participate politically? I can measure this using voter turnout rates and surveys of populations that have experienced such a transition.
